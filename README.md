# Bikes_Sharing


# Tableau Project



## Overview of Project
    
    
    
   
   
   **On this project, we collaborated with our team on creating a strategy to pitch for a  (bike-sharing) business proposal for angel investors looking to get some investors. The goal was to look at Citi bike data in New York City in August to see how this bike-sharing business operates in its high volumes of traffic during summer. After analyzing the data and cleaning it, I developed and  created visualizations to display the trends and opportunities that could be similar  in other cities.**

 **As our final report portion on this project, This presentation was based on New York City data but could be applied,  to other major city in the World.
 we implemented the  final result, which was an interactive dashboard where we  offer a graphical representation of our analysis.**

**During the most profitable month of the year, the most wanted hours people used the bikes were 5 pm and 6 pm. At 8 am during the morning is also a good time that uncovers the trend that people are more likely to use the bikes. **

 **As visually presented on the  User Trips Dashboard, almost 80% of the users are subscribers. At the same time, the remaining are just customers who sometimes use the bikes. Therefore, this means that user retention is pretty high and acceptable, and wherever the bike-sharing business has taken place, we should incentivize customers to become subscribers. To be a little more specific, male subscribers are the most popular users. Many customers happen to avoid gender selection, so they appear as unknown gender. We should try to engage more customers as a whole.**

**In this dashboard, we can see the trip duration by gender. All genders usually use the bikes for 5 minutes approximately. After 5 minutes, the trip durations start to slow down. Almost none of the users use the bikes after 45 minutes, where the hill begins to decline by a lot.**

**In this case, we can appreciate the gender breakdown, which shows that most customers are male with approximately 65% market share; by contrast, women represent 25% and finally unknown gender with 10%. They all share the same heatmap, which shows how they have the same behavior on using bikes. **

**Finally,  Even though this is the map for New York City, we can expect similar behavior in other cities. There is always a more populated area (taking into consideration the most significant part of Manhattan).** 






**If we wanted to give a more macro analysis of the Citi bike business, we created a new visualization in which we observed rides by age. To calculate age, I made a Tableau calculated field in which I used the date of birth to get the period.**
